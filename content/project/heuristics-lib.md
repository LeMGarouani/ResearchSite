## Project still in development...

The aim of the project is to offer some operations research Heuristics for mono or multiple objectives problems. Used as a cpp library, this project can be improve for your own needs.

Into this library, for use Heuristic functions you have to declare your own fitness functions and if it's necessary your solution type based on Solution cpp class.
