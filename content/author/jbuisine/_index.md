I am currently a Temporary Lecturer and Research Assistant in the LISIC at the University of Littoral Côte d'Opale. My research work is mainly focused on noise perception of physics-based rendering images (Monte Carlo approach) using machine learning. I am also working on underlying topics such as statistical extractions combined with deep learning methods for image denoising and the use of surrogate models in the operations research process for feature selection.
